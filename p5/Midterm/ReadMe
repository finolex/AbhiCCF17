Components:

PseudoCode:
- (Environment already almost set up in the openprocessing link)
- Blob: Have multiple ellipses from the same centre point, and opacity 0.8, and then have their y axis be the ground, and the x axis be mouseX
- Contain all code in 2 sections, day and night mode (to change environment, and emotions of blob)


Update 16th October:
-Made both modes
-Finished sun and moon

Left to do:
-Make blob (and then we are done!!!)


Update October 22nd:
- Made blob
- Added cloud
- Added music
- Added stars
- Made all of the proportions in terms of width and height rather than absolute values so that program will run on any screen size

Challenges:
Making blob animated/rotate
Used timer, but still having trouble to integrate/control it to the way I want it to
Asked about the gradient mapping for background, but unclear. Tried it, but failed miserably.

Future:
Address all challenges
Make blob more organic
